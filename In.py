 README
 This software is a simple tool that enables you to inject custom packets
 into RX.py's local testing temporary file. It somewhat simplifies the 
 manual penetration testing process. Be sure to enable injection mode on Rx.py:
 that way Rx.py will switch to read messages/commands from INoutput instead.

     1. Move In.py to local testing directory.

     2. Start Tx.py with local_testing boolean as True.

     3. Start NH.py with local_testing boolean as True
         You might want to comment out lines in NH.py to disable
         sending injection messages to random XMPP addresses.

            o = DBus_MsgSender(xmpp)  // line 283
            o.clearHistory()          // line 284

            o = DBus_MsgSender(xmpp)  // line 325
            o.sender()                // line 326
            
         You might also want to remove CRC checksum
         verification  from Rx.py by commenting out.
         
            if crc32(cmd_mac_line) != crc_pkg:      // lines 2211-2213
                packet_anomality('crc', 'command')
                continue

            if crc32(ct_mac_ln) != crc_pkg:         // lines 2281-2283
                packet_anomality('crc', 'message')
                continue
                                    
     4. Start Rx.py with local_testing and injection_testing boolean as True.

     5. Start In.py
         To inject, start by writing a message with Tx.py.

         In.py opens NHoutput with nano: edit the message.

         Send message with CTRL + <x>, <y>, <ENTER>.

         In.py shows the packet, reads the modified file and saves it as INoutput.

         Rx.py reads INoutput just as it would normally read NHoutput
         and act accordingly. Packet will be cleared after each use.

         Rinse and repeat. Happy hacking. (:

     Dev note: let me know if you can craft a packet that crashes Rx.py:
